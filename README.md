# sign-up-form
A sign up form for the Odin Project

The styling took a while here.  I think it looks pretty close!  The form validation uses native HTML validation with attributes (such as minLength and required) and JS to check that the passwords match.  This also took me a bit of time to figure out but it seems to work well enough.  One thing I learned by doing this project is that you can read an input's HTML validation state in JS by using the node's validity properties.  This is very useful for when you want to use a mixture of HTML validation and JS validation together. :thumbsup:
